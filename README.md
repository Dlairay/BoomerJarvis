you will need to download and set up google cloud sdk to run the gcloud init command in the terminal. this step will link your google cloud console to your code, enabling you to use google api services. 
this step is needed to run the auto translate function in the code. should you decide to not use the google translate function. you will need to alter some of the code related to translation.

create a .env file 
with your openAI api key and google_authentication_credentials(this is a file path to a json file containing your private key to access google cloud services)
